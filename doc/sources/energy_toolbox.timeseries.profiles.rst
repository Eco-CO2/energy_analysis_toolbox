energy\_toolbox.timeseries.profiles package
===========================================

.. automodule:: wattdf.timeseries.profiles
   :members:

   :show-inheritance:

The `profiles` subpackage is a direct migration of the previously existing
`load_profiles` library. It contains functions to compute profiles from
historical variations of a quantity represented as flat timeseries data.

The subpackage is organized as follows:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   wattdf.timeseries.profiles.mean_profile
   wattdf.timeseries.profiles.rolling_profile
   wattdf.timeseries.profiles.localization
   wattdf.timeseries.profiles.preprocessing
   wattdf.timeseries.profiles.thresholds
