Getting started

So you're new to |eat| ? Here is what you need to get started quickly!

Installing from the sources
---------------------------
Installation from sources is mainly intended for developers of the package.
The installation is described using ``pip``:

* Get the sources, the latest version being on `Gitlab`_.
* Checkout the commit/tag/branch you want to install.
* Go to the root of the sources directory. There should be a file
  with name ``setup.py``.
* Run ``pip install ./``. This can be combined with other ``pip``
  options such as ``--prefix`` to chose the target installation directory.
