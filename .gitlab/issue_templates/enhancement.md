# Motivation

Explain why this enhancement seems to be interesting or useful for the project

# Possible solution

Explain what would be expected. Also better with an example for complex issues.
You may illustrate with figures or code snippets of an interface.

# Implementation ideas

Some investigation, possibly with example about, how to implement the feature.
This may be very preliminary.

You can give hints about several possible solutions and start comparing the
pros and cons.

Identify the different use-cases and limit cases and decide how they should be
managed, ideally before implementing.
