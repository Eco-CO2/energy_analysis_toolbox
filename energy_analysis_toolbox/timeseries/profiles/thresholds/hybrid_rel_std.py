        The threshold profile is obtained using a user-defined relative variation

        ----------
        history : pd.Series
            Consumption history used to computed the reference
            profile.
        time_day : pd.Timestamp
            The time at which the profile is of interest. Only
            the information about the date is used in the passed
            timestamp.

        profile : pd.Series
            Profile threshold with same resolution as the history data

        Notes
        -----
        The profile threshold is obtained as an hybrid between the std and
        arbitrary tshd profiles :

            - an average profile is computed from the rolling max of the history
              on a window centered on each slot with size ``window``.
            - a std profile is computed from the history (without rolling max)
            - the returned profile is obtained as the max between :

                * the profile based on ``tshd_std`` standard deviation over the
                  mean profile (the std is computed from the data without rolling
                  aggregation),
                * the profile based on ``(1 + tshd_rel)`` times the mean profile.

        The idea behind this profile is to base the threshold on the data variability,
        but to still have a certain tolerance when the consumption is very stable in
        the (short) history.

        The rolling max also artificially increases the mean value around slots where
        the consumption is high in order to account for the correlation between the
        consumption on consecutive slots : a certain "horizontal" dispersion of the
        consumption is relatively normal.


        .. note:

            In ``self.is_max == False``, replace "max" by "min" in the text above.
